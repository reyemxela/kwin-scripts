## Scripts

### virtual-desktops-only-on-primary6
Windows on monitors other than the primary are automatically pinned to all desktops, essentially disabling the effects of virtual desktops on those monitors.

This is an updated version of the script from [hnjae+wsdfhjxc+others](https://github.com/hnjae/kwin-scripts) to work with KDE Plasma 6.

### virtual-desktop-tiling-fix
A very hacky, very temporary workaround for [#505684](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=505684). Extremely specific to my workflow/use case, please don't use it.
